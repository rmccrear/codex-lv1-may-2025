## 📘 Group Project: HTML & CSS Cheatsheet

### 🎯 Objective:

In your group, create a helpful **HTML & CSS Cheatsheet** to document everything you’ve learned and want to remember. This will be a guide for both **future students** and your **future self** when building websites. You’ll create the guide in **Google Docs**, and later **share it in the Forum on Moodle**.

This cheatsheet should include **code samples** and **at least one screenshot per section** to help explain each concept clearly.

---

### 📂 Required Sections:

Your document must include **all four of these sections**:

---

### 1. 🧱 **Basics of HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**

* Explain what HTML is and what it’s used for
* Describe the structure of an HTML document (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
* List and explain common HTML tags:

  * Headings (`<h1>` through `<h6>`)
  * Paragraphs (`<p>`)
  * Images (`<img>`)
  * Links (`<a>`)
  * Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
* Include a complete example of a simple HTML page
* Add a **screenshot** of a simple webpage or code in a text editor

---

### 2. 🎨 **Basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**

* Explain what CSS is and how it controls the appearance of HTML content
* Show how to link a CSS file to an HTML page using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>`
* Demonstrate common CSS rules and properties, such as:

  * `color`
  * `font-size`
  * `background-color`
  * `margin`
  * `padding`
  * `border`
* Include code samples showing how to write CSS rules and apply them to HTML elements
* Add a **screenshot** of a styled webpage or a CSS file in an editor

---

### 3. ❓ **Confusing or Tricky Parts**

* Choose topics you and your group found confusing or easy to forget
* Examples might include:

  * Writing alt text for images
  * Making links open in a new tab
  * Setting the correct file path for images or CSS
  * Understanding how classes and IDs work
* Write short explanations in your own words
* Include **before and after** code if possible
* Add a **screenshot** of the part that was tricky for you

---

### 4. 🌱 **Things I’d Like to Learn**

* Make a list of topics you are curious about and want to explore in the future
* Ideas may include:

  * Responsive design
  * Grid layout
  * Adding fonts from Google Fonts
  * Starting JavaScript (the language that makes websites interactive)
* You can include questions or links to things you want to explore later

---

### 🖼️ Visuals:

Each section should include **at least one screenshot**:

* Use screenshots of your code or webpages you’ve made
* You can also use helpful diagrams or labeled screenshots

---

### 📤 Submitting:

📌 **Note: this is an ungraded group project.** The purpose is to consolidate your learning gains and to help you retain what you’ve learned about HTML and CSS. Think of it as a note to your future self — a guide you can return to when you need a refresher on how to build a webpage.

* When your group has finished the cheatsheet:

  1. Share the Google Doc with all group members
  2. Post the link in the **Forum on Moodle** with a short description of what’s inside

---

### 🌟 Bonus Challenge (Optional):

If you want to go further, try turning your cheatsheet into an actual website!
Use either:

* [Code.org Web Lab](https://studio.code.org/projects/weblab), **or**
* Your own computer with a text editor and browser

Recreate the same sections, but this time using real HTML and CSS files to build your own guide.

Consider using:

* ...[PRE tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_pre.asp) and [CODE tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_code.asp) for your code examples
* ...[HTML Enities](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp) for HTML code examples that need angle brackets.

---

### 💡 Tips:

* Split up the sections and assign them to different group members
* Use headers and bullet points to keep your document organized
* Check your spelling and formatting
* Think of this guide as a gift to your future self!
