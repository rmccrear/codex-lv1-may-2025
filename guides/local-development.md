# Guide to developing HTML\&CSS on your local filesystem.

**What is a filesystem?** A filesystem is system that stores files for you. These can be any sort of file: image files like PNG JPEG or GIF. They can be proprietary formats like DOCX XLS or PSD. They can be web formats like HTML CSS or JS.

**What is a local filesystem?** A local filesystem is a filesystem that lives on your computer. The bits and bytes are actually on the hard drive sitting next to you. This contrasts with a remote filesystem where the bits and bytes are stored in a data center. The files on [code.org](http://code.org) are considered “remote” because they are are stored in an online web application called Web Lab. The difference between remote and local can blur. For example, you may have a OneDrive subscription which syncs your local files to a remote datacenter. In this case the files would be both remote and local because they are stored on both your local hard drive and in the remote datacenter with OneDrive.

**Why develop locally?** So far, we have been writing code on [code.org](http://code.org). This has pros and cons. It is easy to get started with [code.org](http://code.org), it organizes our projects for us, and, our files are easy to share since they are already on the Internet. But what if the Internet goes down? What is [code.org](http://code.org) is slow? What if we want custumizaitons beyond what [code.org](http://code.org) allows? For this we need to download the files to our computer and edit our code locally. In our class and in your career you will need to develop locally and remotely, depending on the circumstances. Let’s learn one way to develop code locally.

## Download a file from Web Lab

Let’s start by downloading the HTML files we created on [code.org](http://code.org).

**Do this:**

1. Open your Project in Web Lab on [code.org](http://code.org).  
2. Click the dropdown button on index.html and download the file.  
3. Find the downloaded file and double click on it.   
4. View it in your browser, it should show your HTML but no CSS or images.

**Show me:**

## Download your full project

Now let’s download the rest of your project.

**Do this:**

1. Create a new folder in your Documents folder to contain all your HTML, CSS, and image files.   
2. Download all the files from your project into this folder.  
3. Make sure you have downloaded all the files and they are all in the same folder.  
4. Double click on the index.html file and view it in your browser. You should see your complete website.

## Update files locally

Now let’s try and update the HTML files locally.

**Do this:**

1. Right click on your index.html file.  
2. Select Open with…  
3. Select Notepad on Windows and TextEdit on Mac. (Text on Chromebook.)  
4. You should see your HTML code just as you did on [code.org](http://code.org).  
5. Try to make a change to one of your H1 tags.  
6. Save the file.  
7. Reload the file in your browser to see your updates.

## Set up local development

Set yourself up for local development, so that your are just as efficient locally as your are remotely. You will have to tile your windows to mimic the setup on [code.org](http://code.org). If you have never “tiled” windows, see the link to a video here: (windows: [How to Arrange Windows and Multitask in Windows 11](https://youtu.be/iw8ExQKWwrk?feature=shared&t=92)) (mac: [How to use window tiling on Mac | Apple Support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3KAmUYkkVc)) (chromebook [Chromebook: Tiling two horizontal screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9tM5w7txC4))

**Do this:**

1. Tile your Notepad or TextEdit application to the left.  
2. Tile your web browser to the right.  
3. Make a change in your code and save it with a hotkey (CTRL S).  
4. Reload the page in your broswer.  
5. Check that the changes have been made.
