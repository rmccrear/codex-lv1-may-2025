# Guide to Developing HTML & CSS on Your Local Filesystem

## What is a Filesystem?

A **filesystem** is how your computer stores all types of files—images (PNG, JPEG, GIF), documents (DOCX, XLS, PSD), or web files (HTML, CSS, JS).

## What is a Local Filesystem?

A **local filesystem** is the storage physically located on your own computer (your hard drive). This is different from a **remote filesystem**, where files are stored online in a data center or cloud service. For example:
- Files on code.org are **remote**—stored online.
- Files synced with OneDrive can be both **local and remote** (on your device and in the cloud).

## Why Develop Locally?

Code.org makes starting projects easy; your work is organized and shareable. But:
- What if the Internet goes down?
- What if code.org is slow?
- What if you need customizations code.org doesn’t offer?

This is why you need to know how to develop code locally as well as online.
